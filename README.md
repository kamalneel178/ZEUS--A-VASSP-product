## VASSP (Vulnerability analysers and system security providers) - Project ZEUS
A smart, intelligent, video analytic software that can detect malicious activity, accidents, thefts in real time and can be easily integrated with the current surveillance system and can work as a standalone too.

### Overview
We are developing a video analytic software that can be integrated with the current surveillance system and can work as a standalone too. The software ZEUS can detect malicious activity, accidents, thefts in real time,and then sends the data to the client system, which in turn get the real time feed. All of this takes about a second and will allow the authorities to take preventive measure as soon as possible. Since the CCTV is an omnipresent device, it can be easily implemented in any field with some miniscule changes. We have a sustainable business model and integrate with the current system rather spending money and changing the system. The prototype has been developed and are now in the process of developing the product and test it.

### Target Customers
In the initial phase, we will be focusing on the transport sector and the ATM's. Private parties such as Firms, Shopping malls, Petrol pumps, Colleges ec can be added.

### Technology Used
1. Tensorflow
2. Shell script
3. Javascript
4. PHP
5. AES 128 Encryption
6. Python

### Scalability
There has been an identified need for the security of the people of India. But, feasible steps for the same have not been taken. We are offering a system that can be applied to any field/place with a cctv,which further can ensure the security. Currently,our main focus is on the transport sector and the ATMs of the state, country or institution, but in future we are planning to expand to various sectors/private firms. According to the finance ministry of India, there were 139 cases of ATM thefts in India. The cctv which were present at the location were only used for their surveillance video long after the incident occurred. In addition to it, there were reports of casualties, which in most of the cases were security guards.
